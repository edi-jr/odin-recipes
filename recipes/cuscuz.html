  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The Brazilian Couscous from the Northeast Region also known as Corn Couscous is a nutritious, cheap and a really
    simple recipe to make. It is a North African dish brought to Brazil by Portuguese colonizers.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>250 g pre cooked flaked corn flour or pre cooked corn flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon manioc starch</li>
    <li>400 ml water, approximately</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the corn flour, manioc starch and salt, together, in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the water and mix well until all ingredients are moist and mixture has a crumbly texture. Let it
      stand for 10 minutes. Manioc starch makes the couscous more compact, but you can also prepare the recipe without
      it.</li>
    <li>Fill the steamer pot half full of water.</li>
    <li>Place the couscous mixture into the steamer basket and gently level the top without pressing. The mixture should
      remain soft to allow the steam to penetrate just right.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes, until it begins to release its aroma. At this point the
      mixture starts to pull away from the sides of the steamer.</li>
    <li>Cut into slices and serve hot. Add butter, molasses, coconut milk or milk (hot or cold, sweetened or
      unsweetened), if you like. It is a very versatile side dish to vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, cheese, coconut and
      sweet courses.</li>
  </ol>
